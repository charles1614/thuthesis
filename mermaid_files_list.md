# Mermaid Diagram Files for Thesis (Updated - Overview + Details Approach)

The following Mermaid diagram files have been created for the thesis chapters with a focus on system overview first, then implementation details. All diagrams use English text and academic blue/white color schemes. Please use your script to convert them to PDF format and then provide instructions for insertion into the thesis.

## Generated Mermaid Files

### 1. System Architecture Overview

### 6. Knowledge Distillation Process
- **File**: `figures/knowledge_distillation.mmd`
- **Description**: Detailed knowledge distillation mechanism between teacher and student models
- **Usage**: Chapter 3, Section 3.3 (Knowledge Distillation Framework)
- **Academic Colors**: Professional academic color scheme

### 7. Gaussian Densification Algorithm
- **File**: `figures/gaussian_densification.mmd`
- **Description**: Adaptive Gaussian densification and pruning algorithm flow
- **Usage**: Chapter 3, Section 3.4 (Adaptive Densification & Geometric Optimization)
- **Academic Colors**: Academic blue/white color scheme

## Notes for PDF Generation

1. All diagrams use English text and professional academic color schemes (blue/white theme)
2. Mathematical notation is included where appropriate (e.g., ùí¢_bkgd, SE(3), etc.)
3. Code references are accurate and based on actual implementation
4. Diagrams are designed for academic publication standards (CVPR/AAAI level)

## Next Steps

1. Run your script to convert all .mmd files to PDF format
2. Place the generated PDF files in the `figures/` directory
3. I will then insert the appropriate `\includegraphics` commands in the thesis chapters
4. Update figure captions and labels for proper cross-referencing
